This is a **module** built in PHP for the [Kohana framework](http://www.kohanaphp.com)

It creates a simple socket server that forks off to a child process to handle individual connections. Using some custom headers, the server will use a specified protocol to interpret data streams.

An RPC protocol is in development.
